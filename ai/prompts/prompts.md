- Create an educational infographic on aged, lined, spiral-bound notebook paper with a [9:16] ratio, based on the above information. The visual aesthetic must use realistic, detailed colored pencil and watercolor textures for illustrations alongside neat, printed architectural-style handwriting for text. Design the page with a decorative main title banner at the top, followed by the most fundamental definitions and a large, cinematic panoramic illustration spanning the width of the page. Below this, organize key concepts into a bulleted list section using stylized checkmark icons, and divide the remaining lower half of the page into a modular grid of distinct, rectangular boxes, where each box contains a specific, fully labeled comparative diagram or classification illustration with its own descriptive caption. Use no titles other than the main one.
